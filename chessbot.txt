This chess game features an impressive combination of moves that leads to a checkmate. White begins with a knight fork to capture the black bishop on f6 and open up the g-file. 
Black responds by counter-attacking on the queenside with a pawn push to b5. 
White then moves their queen to d2 to protect their rook, while their other rook moves to the g-file. 
White then sacrifices the rook on h5 to open the h-file and create a discovered attack on the black king. 
The black king moves to h7 in an effort to find safety, but this does not work as White's queen moves to g5 to threaten mate. 
The black pawn on b4 then captures the White rook, only to be captured by the White queen. This leads to a checkmate on g7.
